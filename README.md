**data_expectations**  
Is your data meeting your expectations?

----

A delarative approach to asserting qualities of your datasets. For example, instead
of a test such as `is_sorted` to determine if a column is ordered, the expectation
is `column_values_are_increasing`. Most of the time you don't need to know _how_ it
got like that, you are only interested _what_ the data looks like.
